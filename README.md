# Router
The goal of the assignment was to determine the paths to connect all of the cities on a map while minimizing the total cost (elevation) using Dijkstra's. We were given the number of cities and the width of the map as the first line of input. The next lines of input were the coordinates of each of those cities. After those lines, we were given a map of elevations, like so:
3 5
1 3
0 2
0 3
 3 55 29 1 2
 5 62 46 3 6
 3 59 83 4 8
 5 72 51 3 6
 4 71 34 2 6
